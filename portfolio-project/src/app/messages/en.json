I specialize in bridging business needs and technical solutions through strong communication, project management, and hands-on development using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Python/Django. This site was built by me, and reflects my passion for building scalable, user-friendly web applications that combine client support experience with modern full-stack engineering."

My primary stack includes TypeScript, React (Next.js), Node.js, and PostgreSQL. With experience supporting SaaS platforms in both the US and Japan, I bring structured delivery, clear communication, and strong ownership to remote engineering teams.",
        "longDescriptionOne" : "I began my career in SaaS consulting within the energy industry, working at the intersection of business requirements and technical implementation. I supported client onboarding, validated data pipelines, worked with APIs, and collaborated closely with engineering teams to ensure systems aligned with real-world market constraints.",
        "longDescriptionTwo" : "Over time, I became increasingly interested in the technical architecture behind those systems — how APIs were structured, how authentication was handled, how data models were designed, and how small engineering decisions impacted long-term maintainability. That curiosity led me to transition fully into hands-on full-stack development.",
        "longDescriptionThree" : "Today, I build API-driven web applications using TypeScript, React (Next.js), Node.js, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I focus on backend architecture, relational data modeling, authentication flows, and building maintainable frontend systems that scale cleanly.",
        "longDescriptionFour" : "My consulting background continues to shape how I approach engineering. I prioritize clarity, system coherence, and thoughtful implementation over quick patches. I build software with long-term support and extensibility in mind."
